### Tornado

An async based web framework of python.

This repo holds source files for my youtube channel.

The [official](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) guide can be found here.

In order to setup the environment you should issue the following commands if you are on windows.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/r3ap3rpy/trnado
cd trnado
virtualenv trndo
trndo\scripts\activate
pip install tornado
```
